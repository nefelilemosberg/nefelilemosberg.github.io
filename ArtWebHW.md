## Rhizome's Net Art Anthology

Mobile Image is a series of art projects that looked at how emerging telecommunication technology could connect people in creative ways. Their works used satellites, live video, and computer networks to bring different communities together. They reimagined technologies as a place for human expression. 

I found the Satellite Arts Project very interesting because it explored how technology could enable collaboration of artists across distances. By bringing together dancers and musicians from different locations into the same onscreen space, they redefined what it meant to be present and connected in a performance. The project reimagined media as a place for connection that prioritized community and creativity, which was an idea that I found very inspiring.
